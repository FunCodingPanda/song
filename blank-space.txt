I don't know the lyrics to the song because there are too many songs to choose from. 
The second line to the song is going to be about mushrooms.
The third line of the song is referring to my love for red mushrooms. 
The fourth line is all about the love making mushrooms. 
There are also the destroying angel and the death cap mushrooms. Eat that s*** and you wish that you ate s***. 
Reading this again, I laughed so hard.
